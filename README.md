Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras

## MNIST dataset:

MNIST is a collection of handwritten digits from 0-9. 
Image of size 28 X 28

## Description
This is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. 

It achieved 98.51% of accuracy with this CNN trained on a GPU, which took me about a minute.
